# Cutler Fellowship

This project revolved around a scholarship given to me by Olivet College which was donated by David Cutler. In acceptance of the scholarship the recepient is required to contribute something to Mathematics or Computer Science.

# My Contribution
## Project
My goal is provide an open-course tool that will load in files generated by the website [url here]. Then it spit out graphs with the option to smooth the data from a variety of options

## Requirements
### For data processing
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

### For database integration
* [SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.org/)
* [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/)
  * [psycopg2](http://initd.org/psycopg/)

### Gui Drawing
* [Kivy](https://Kivy.org)

### Relational Model for Data
* [Quick Schema PDF](http://athena.codes/images/relationalmodel.pdf)
 * Underlined values are Primary Keys. FK dependants are referenced in the next column
 * It is worth noting that this may change quick a bit, check back.
* [ER Diagram](http://athena.codes/images/erdia.png)

### First Gui Draft Designs
* [Main Window](http://athena.codes/images/Sample.1.MainWindow.png)
* [Detected New Files](http://athena.codes/images/Sample.1.Detected.png)
 * For when the program detects files that haven't been input into the database
